# Hi there, I'm Tunahan 👋

I'm an IT Support Specialist currently transitioning into Cloud & DevOps roles.

With 4+ years of experience in end-user and infrastructure support, I'm now focused on building real-world projects using AWS and infrastructure-as-code tools.

### 🧠 Current Focus
- AWS services: EC2, IAM, S3, CloudWatch
- Serverless & Event-driven design (Lambda-based triggers)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Git & CLI-based infrastructure automation

### 📂 Projects
- [EC2 to S3 IAM Role Integration](https://github.com/tnhkoc/EC2-to-S3-IAM-Role-Integration)
- [Lambda S3 File Trigger](https://github.com/tnhkoc/lambda-s3-file-trigger)
- [EC2 CPU Utilization Alarm with SNS Notification](https://github.com/tnhkoc/ec2-health-monitoring)
- [Static Website Hosting with Amazon S3 + CloudFront](https://github.com/tnhkoc/static-website-s3-cloudfront)

More labs coming soon — aiming to contribute daily.

### 🌍 Open to relocation for Cloud/DevOps roles across EU/UK
