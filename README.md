# Hi there, I'm Tunahan 👋

I'm a Platform Support Specialist currently gaining hands-on experience with monitoring tools like Grafana and Prometheus, while continuing my transition into Cloud & DevOps engineering.

With 4+ years in IT support and infrastructure roles, I'm now focused on building real-world automation projects using AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes.

### 🧠 Current Focus
- Core AWS Services: EC2, IAM, S3, CloudWatch
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Monitoring with Grafana & Prometheus
- Kubernetes fundamentals (Minikube, deployments, YAML)
- Git & CLI-based automation
- Event-driven architecture (Lambda triggers, S3 Events)

### 📂 Projects
